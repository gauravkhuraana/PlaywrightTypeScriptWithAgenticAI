### 2. **Advanced Search Result Validation Test** 
`should perform advanced search with result validation @search @advanced`

**Features:**
- Performance monitoring with start/stop measurement
- Comprehensive result validation (count, statistics, titles, URLs)
- Keyword relevance checking for search results
- Pagination testing (next/previous page navigation)
- Search result URL validation with regex patterns
- Core Web Vitals and performance metrics collection
- Detailed Allure reporting with attachments

**Validations:**
- Result count within reasonable limits (1-20 per page)
- Result statistics presence and format
- Title and URL extraction and validation
- Relevant keyword matching in search results
- Page navigation functionality
- Performance thresholds

### 3. **Search Result Interaction Test**
`should test search result interaction and navigation @search @interaction`

**Features:**
- Click on individual search results
- Navigation between search results and target pages
- Back navigation testing
- New search from results page
- URL validation at each step
- Screenshot capture at key points

**Validations:**
- Successful navigation to clicked results
- Proper back navigation to search results
- Search functionality from results page
- URL consistency and correctness

### 4. **Comprehensive Search Suggestions Test**
`should test comprehensive search suggestions and autocomplete @search @suggestions`

**Features:**
- Multiple partial query testing with different keywords
- Search suggestion extraction and validation
- Relevance checking for suggestions
- Suggestion selection simulation
- Related searches functionality testing
- Screenshot capture for each suggestion scenario

**Test Cases:**
- `playwright` → validates automation-related suggestions
- `javascript` → validates JS/tutorial suggestions  
- `selenium` → validates webdriver/automation suggestions

**Validations:**
- Suggestion count and relevance
- Related search extraction and testing
- Suggestion selection functionality

### 5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling Test**
`should handle edge cases and error scenarios @search @edge-cases`

**Comprehensive Edge Cases:**
- Empty search behavior
- Very long search queries (200+ characters)
- Special characters and symbols testing
- No results scenarios
- Multilingual search queries

**Special Character Testing:**
- Symbols: `!@#$%^&*()`
- Quotes and apostrophes
- Numbers and mixed content
- Hyphens, underscores, dots, commas

**Multilingual Testing:**
- Spanish: `búsqueda en español`
- French: `recherche en français`
- German: `Suche auf Deutsch`
- Japanese: `日本語検索`

### 6. **Accessibility and Performance Validation Test**
`should validate accessibility and comprehensive performance metrics @search @accessibility @performance`

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Search duration measurement
- Core Web Vitals collection (FCP, LCP)
- Page load metrics analysis
- Memory usage tracking
- Comprehensive performance report generation

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Axe-core accessibility scanning
- ARIA labels and landmarks validation
- Heading structure analysis
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast and form accessibility

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Search completion: < 10 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: < 5 seconds  
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 6 seconds

**Accessibility Standards:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checking
- Keyboard accessibility validation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure validation
